# Avocado Production Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict avocado production in the year 2022 using linear regression. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and is provided in the `avocado-production-data.csv` file.

## Dataset

The dataset contains avocado production data by year. You can download the dataset [here](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCLinks) or use the provided `avocado-production-data.csv` file.

## Prediction

To predict avocado production in 2022, we have employed linear regression. The estimated production for 2022, along with the Python code for the linear regression model, is included in this repository.

## Files

- `avocado-production-data.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `avocodopredict2022.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for linear regression and the prediction for avocado production in 2022.
- `predictavocado2022.py`: Python file containing the Python code for linear regression and the prediction for avocado production in 2022.

## Instructions

1. Download the dataset from [FAO](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCLinks) or use the provided `avocado-production-data.csv`.
2. Execute the code in `linear_regression_prediction.ipynb` to obtain the prediction for avocado production in 2022.

## Usage

Feel free to use or modify the provided Python code for your analysis. If you find any improvements or have suggestions, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
